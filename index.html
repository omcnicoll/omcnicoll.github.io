    <p>I am a Canadian-American Computer Engineer currently living in Boston, MA. I moved to Boston in 2012 to attend Northeastern University and never left after earning my degree. I was a rower in college and have a freshly renewed interest in biking, both mountain and road.</p>
    <p>I am currently working as a Sitecore developer for Rightpoint, hence the Sitecore blog found on this site. More than anything, I’m just looking for new problems to solve.</p>
    <h2 id="what-will-you-find-here">What will you find here?</h2>
    <p>Do you ever find yourself googling trivial questions like <code class="highlighter-rouge">How to undo git commit</code>, never mind the fact you’ve done it 100 times before? This blog is a bit like that, chronicling small nuggets of information I find myself looking back for over and over again. Really it’s to use as my own source of knowledge, but hopefully you can prosper from it as well!</p>
